Benchmarking is the process of testing the performance of specific operations repeatedly. 

Profiling involves running many lines of code to find out where bottlenecks lie. 

Two measures for computational efficiency
- Relative time: df$name[3] is 25% faster than df[3, "name"];
- Absolute time: df$name[3] is 5 microseconds faster than df[3, "name"].
