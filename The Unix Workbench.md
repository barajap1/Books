Command line basics:

- You type command line commands after the prompt.
- clear will clean up your terminal.
- echo prints text to your terminal.
- You can scroll through your command history with the Up and Down arrow keys
- You can identify a specific file or folder by its path.
- The root directory (/) contains all of the folders and files on your computer.
- Your home directory (~) is the directory where your terminal always starts.
- Your terminal is always inside of a working directory.
- When you open your terminal your working directory will be set to the home directory.
- Use the cd command to change your working directory.
- he pwd command will print the working directory.
- The ls command will list files and folders in a directory.
- Use mkdir to create new directories.
- The touch command creates empty files.
- ou can use > to redirect the output of a command into a file.
- '>> will append command output to the end of a file.
- Print a text file to the command line using cat.
- Inspect properties of a text file with wc.
- Peak at the beginning and end of a text file with head and tail.
- Scroll through a large text file with less.
- nano is simple text editor.
- mv can be used for moving or renaming files or folders.
- cp can copy files or folders.
- You should try to avoid using rm which permanently removes files or folders
- Use man to look up the documentation for a command.
- If you can't think of the name of a command use apropos to search for a word associated with that command.
- If you have access to a web browser, using a search engine might be better than man or apropos.
- Wildcards can represent many kinds and numbers of characters.
- The star wildcard (*) represents zero or more of any character.
- You can use wildcards on the command line in order to work with multiple files and folders.
- grep and egrep can be used along with regular expressions to search for patterns of text in a file.
- Metacharacters are used in regular expressions to describe patterns of characters.
- find can be used to search for the names of files in a directory.
- history displays what commands we've entered into the console since opening our current terminal.
- The ~/.bash_history file lists commands we've used in the past.
- alias creates a command that can be used as a substitute for a longer command that we use often.
- The ~/.bash_profile is a text file that is run every time we start a shell, and it's the best place to assign aliases.
- The md5 and shasum commands use different algorithms to create codes (called hashes or checksums) that are unique to the contents of a file.
- These hashes can be used to ensure that a file is genuine.
